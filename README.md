## Overview

//TODO summary

**Fixed Mouseclick controls**

 - Turns the character in the direction of your MouseClick, when using MouseClicks for tools.
 (This doesn't change functions of clicking with 'C'.)
 
The game's normal functions for turning a character with mouse clicks check what specific tile is clicked,
requiring that the exact tile next to the character is clicked in order to turn the character towards it.
This simple mod makes it so that clicking in the general direction of a tile is enough to turn the character.

**Slick Moves!**

I always found it slightly boring to stand completely still, spamming my sword at innocent slimes.
I decided to add the option to move a bit during attack and block moves.

  - ***Sideways Swipe***
