## Overview


***Fixed Mouseclick controls***

 - Turns the character in the direction of your click, when using mouse clicks for tools.
 (This doesn't change functions of clicking with 'C'.)
 
The game's normal functions for turning a character with mouse clicks check what specific tile is clicked,
requiring that the exact tile next to the character is clicked in order to turn the character towards it.
This simple mod makes it so that clicking in the general direction of a tile is enough to turn the character.

***Slick Moves!***

I always found it slightly boring to stand completely still, spamming my sword at innocent slimes.
I decided to add the option to move a bit during attack and block moves.

  - **Sideways Swipe**: When running and attacking to the sides, the character will slide along the ground while swinging the weapon.
  - **Block Dash**: A quick dash while blocking, used by hitting 'left-click' immediately after blocking and moving in the direction you want to dash.
